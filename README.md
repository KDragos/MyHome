My Home by Kristin Dragos

My second project for Udacity's Virtual Reality Nanodegree. 

Estimated completion time: 6 hours. 

The most challenging part of this project was intercepting the trigger events. I wanted to use the provided teleport script that teleported users to a different location on each trigger. However, I wanted users to be able to click items in the scene and have animations play or actions happen. To solve this, I added some code in the GvrReticle class that will look to see if the selected object has a tag of "Clickable." If it doesn't have the tag, the users will teleport. If the object has the tag, they will stay where they are, and something else will happen. 

I really liked being able to add functionality to my scene. Water comes out of the faucet. The tv and computers can be turned on and off. The globe will spin, and continue to spin until stopped. I also enjoy the realistic feal of the baked lighting.
